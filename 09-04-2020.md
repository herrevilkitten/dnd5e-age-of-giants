After having cleared the Goblins from the first floor of the Inn, our heroes were confronted by the Goblin Leader Mok, Sneering upon their success he casually returned upstairs daring the Reavers to follow. Smelling a trap, Gillikan, Agress, Shava and Farora began taking tables, chairs, anything they could get their hands on blocking off the windows, kitchen and front door. Listening intently at the stairs while the others blocked the entrances, Seamus and Tul heard someone being dragged and gagged above them. As the group gathers at the stairs preparing to ascend, Seamus and Tul inform the rest of the situation. As they begin to ascend, suddenly two spears shoot past the heads of Seamus and Tul hurled by Muk. Quickly the Goblin leader runs into a room next to him. After clearing the other rooms, the Reavers confronted the Goblin leader holding a hostage. Shava going through the exterior of the Inn After stalling them for a moment the leader throws his hostage into a gaping hole to the bar area below and shoots an explosive crossbow bolt igniting a fire in the floor below.

The Goblin then jumps through the window hoping to make a quick escape to a waiting group of Goblins and one of his Lieutenants. Unfortunately for him Shava had other plans. Grabbing his hair and ripping it loose mid jump, he tumbles to the ground with Shava careening down right behind him. Anticipating the attack the Goblin rolls out of the way at the last moment and takes off running narrowly dodging the rapier from Agress as she leapt out the now cleared window. Seamus following right behind Agress shouts out "NIght night!" and renders 2 of the goblins unconscious. Not missing an opportunity Shava chased after the fleeing Muk and struck the final blow. Quickly she grabbed the Horn of retreat and blew it right away. Seeing their leader go down the nearby approaching goblins flee for their lives.

After spending some time getting the fire at the inn contained, befriending a flying cat, closing the front gate, getting to know Kella, and "checking the town for survivors" (a.k.a. looting the town) the group encountered 3 guards asking for help crossing the collapsed bridge to the castle. getting across the bridge the group saved the Lady of the Castle who was on the brink of death from a stone that landed on her head during an attack by cloud giants. The Lady offered the group 500 gold in return for attempting to rescue the villagers that were taken by the goblins.

After resting for the night and keeping an eye on Kella, the group woke to the sound of the Goblin hoard arriving. Blowing the horn from within the keep in a panic the group try to come up with contingency plans against the approaching horde. Joining the Lady atop the keep they see the captain of the horde bearing a striking resemblance to the now dead Goblin Leader...
