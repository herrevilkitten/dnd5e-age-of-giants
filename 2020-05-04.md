Clearly, Agress’s earlier distraction worked. From what Farora told me, Gurash was furious over being attacked by the female ogre’s mate. He actually commanded his warriors and the goblins to turn on the ogre, though the goblins were pleading for the orcs not to kill her.
Brazenly, Farora dashed back and forth from our secure vantage point where we could see the large cavern of enemies gathering. She relayed to our group of their immense, growing numbers and soon used the magicks to sow dissent among the goblins. Farora spoke in the Goblin tongue, and then the little one* started to imitate her, mimicking her speech in both language, pattern, and content. Farora later told me that her speech challenged the goblins, noting that it was “better to not die on your knees” in subservience to a greater power. I wonder if Farora knew in that moment how right that statement was, as my own past is evidence of that truth.
*Gilikan probably only ever refers to Seamus as “Seamus” during serious times. Otherwise, it’s always some reference to his size.
Of course, we were soon overtaken by the goblins — ones who bought into Farora’s deception and also ones who didn’t. At this point my memories begin to blur. Seemingly convinced that our small party would now have to fight another army, I began to contemplate defensive strategies (using Shava’s speed to secure an exit, thinking about how the wee man once put a whole party of goblins to sleep...) only to be shocked out of my stupor by hearing Agress declare that she would challenge the power of Gurash the Orc Leader in a deadly one-to-one battle.
Soon, Farora, Shava, Tel, and I were placed on the outer ring of gladiatorial combat with a contingent of orc guards and Gurash’s wife, and I lost sight of the half-man as we were moved into place. In the center: Agress. Alone. Unafraid. It had only been three days since I saw her enter combat the first time, smiling at her backside as she recklessly ran from the forest to attack goblins like a carefree child. Now, in this moment, I could only ask myself: “what have we gotten into?!”
Gurash’s fury was self-evident as he huffed and puffed around the arena throwing javelins and weapons into the ground. He even taunted the Elven folk in our party by showing off his necklace of Elven ears. As his own contingent boosted him, so, too, did our small group try to support Agress, who also began to taunt and mock the orc leader. The cries for revolution rang throughout the crowd as Agress noted

 Gurash’s weak, manipulative leadership that demanded others to do the hard labor and work of security and defense.
As the battle started, rather than raise her rapier, Agress began to sing, barely above a whisper. And then, as if struck by some unseen power, Gurash dashed out of the makeshift arena fleeing like a coward, breaking the rules he established for the challenge! Agress rightfully predicted his weakness, and the stunned crowd (our party included) seemed to agree, but as the noise of the goblins and orcs discussing Gurash’s fear waved through the crowd, he re-entered the arena as if to attack.
Taking this opportunity to our advantage, Tel and I crossed paths as he dashed towards the orc soldiers, and I attempted to run my pike through Gurash’s body. Though I managed to run through his body twice, he simply ripped the pike out of his body and dropped it to the ground, only partially fazed by the attack. Soon, I was surrounded by orc guards, and Shava began her assault on the them. Farora attempted the diplomatic approach by talking to the Goblin Queen, and I finally spotted the Seamus on the far side of the battle arena ready to join the fray we all entered.
And then the most astounding thing happened. As if possessed by some unseen force, Gurash disengaged from battles, approached his wife, and killed her in front of everyone.
The cave erupted.
From the ceiling, dozens of goblins descended upon Gurash, and dozens if not hundreds more soon massacred the orc contingent in the cave. The chief hobgoblin, stunned by the actions of Gurash, decapitated him, leaving our party to escape as quickly as we could.
The little man gathered together the surviving townsfolk, and we managed to escape the cave, returning to Nightstone. The trip back was uneventful outside of telling Murak that his inn was not in the best of shape and freeing the goblin watcher we tied up earlier that morning.
Our safe return and the return of the villagers yielded a hero’s feast at the castle of Nightstone held by the Lady Velarosa Nandar. I distanced myself from the Elven contingent, while Shava, Farora, and Agress all fell into favor with the Lord Rond Arrowhome for the feats they accomplished. In fact, Arrowhome, in a show of great respect, thanked Agress for (seemingly) helping to avenge the murder of Lord Arrowhome’s father, who was just recently killed by Gurash.

 The dinner was glorious. More food than we’d had in days living off rations, though not as good as the food at that mysterious inn. Our party did find out that Xolkin’s Zentaran group funded Lady Nandar’s brother and his escapades, possibly even funding much of this city’s infrastructure, which is why they felt they had a claim on recapturing it after the giant’s attack. Farora and Shava informed the Lady about some menace that was still living in the caves. We also heard of the mysterious city gem/jewel/shiny thing that was stolen from the town center — though my memory of those details is spare considering I was busy eating when the Lady Nandar was telling us about its absence.
[As Gilikan slept that night and unknown to him, Shava spent time “interrogating” an elf from Lord Arrowhome’s party. It seems that in the short time they have spent together, the lord and lady have become increasingly close — a level of closeness that this particular elf found unsettling. But what Lady Nandar doesn’t know is that Lord Arrowhome is the man that killed her brother! Shocking!]


The next morning as the party gathered their belongings and met in the town’s square, Murak asked the party to deliver the news of some deaths to settlements in the north:

* Tryboar (trading post), a husband died
* Goldenfields (farmlands and wheat fields), parents died
* Bryn Shander (large city, the city of ten), a sibling died

The party left Nightstone, with the promise of sharing this news as they continued looking for work as Reavers. By mid-day, it was clear something was not right as the clouds moved ominously against their typical patterns, closer and closer to the group. By dusk, the clouds had revealed themselves more clearly to the party as a gargantuan castle tower floating above the layers of clouds beneath.
