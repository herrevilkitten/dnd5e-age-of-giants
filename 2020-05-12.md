 AT AN INN OF WATERDEEP MANY YEARS FROM NOW
 
“On a grassy knoll outside of town. There once was a party of heroes seeking safety within this very Inn. Chased they were by a castle on a cloud with no knowledge of it being friend or foe. Now sit back drink your ale, as I recount for you the tale. But don’t forget...tip your bard lest he or she cast phantasmal force on ye.”
On a night such as this
Stood our heroes most daring A thousand feet down
from a castle unerring
Facing their fate
Without fear or regret They knocked on the door Most thick and precise Welcomed they were
By a goblin suprise...
Twas Terrance the first Washed, clothed and engaged Into the room of his master
He bid them “intrude”
A giants form with a fog for a beard Descended to question our heroes held dear. Anguished he was at the loss of a stone
To seek out their plan this was his goal
Information he sought Lore he then dropped Food was provided And sleep he then got.
A portent was granted Revealing the trials And as they all snored The devils approached
With daggers aloft Audience they sought Where art thou Zephyros! Show us or die!
You will die first
Gilli declared Noting that Tel
Was fast by his side
But ignoring a gnome Is not all that wise With a flick of a coin

 A wink and a smile Seamus did bring us Singed wings from on high
Upon the fair maidens The devils descended But Ffft fft fft
Responded their missiles
Devils they’d seemed Till Shava appeared
To pummel and punch Their face most severe
The Devils defeated Retreated in fear With Tel in their claws For dinner to feed
But run from a monk These cowards knew not Will end with you dead Cause damn they be quick
Fly you damn bird Tel is ahead
Rip your dear friend Or ill take your head
This you may know Dwarves do not float So Tel had to fall With Armor and all
But with heroes nearby Regrets were not had
For a giants short reach
Is as long as his......BEARD!
Up from above
young Terrance
Did beckon
Raise the master
For somethings a matter
Woken from slumber
The master recounted The ording was started And giants have gathered
No time to rest The devils did offer To go back in time

 And forget all that happened Only together
Could they hope gather
The magic so tender
That had been so tethered
Unsure of the truth Zephyros did wonder Can I trust Yan the Bin So strong and so clever
Wait all this must
I will answer tomorrow For now he did suffer Something to ponder
Close we are
The giant professed But safety was not So easy to get
A roar was heard
Most shrill and most feared Approaching with dwarves Held in his rear
The heroes did fight
A dragon resplendent With Nerle at their side Cold and gigantic
But here we are
Close to the end
With a lesson to learn Both true and unpleasant
Not all who fight
Should be bashed and abolished Sometimes a dwarf
Will hold back his hammer
To hear for a moment A heartfelt petition As long as its offered In truth and inaction
So it was done
By Agress and Tel And here it is told Hope was restored
Dragon and Giant Thus held their temper To hear out the other

 Despite their endeavor
So with regret
This I must tell you Our heroes did not Vanquish a dragon
But toss me a coin
And perhaps I will tell you Of the time they did tender That story most clever
