As I felt the satisfying click of the lock and the door swing open, Farora deftly shot at the goblins, whilst Agress yelled out, cutting them deep with her words. I ran over to attack the hobgoblin but found myself swinging empty, distracted by the villagers in the pit below. Everyone leapt into action. Seamus shot bolts of fire, Farora used her magics to turn her arrow into a terrible thorny trap. Gilikan and Tel worked in sync, like brethren of their hammers, slamming the face of the hobgoblin into a blackened, bloody mess. Agress continued to hurl abuse at our enemies and I felt strangely inspired by her ability to turn words into weapons. I pursued the goblin attempting to run, swinging my quarterstaff but as it connected, I felt a sickening crunch. The life left his eyes and he fell backwards into the pit. May the Gods forgive me, it wasn't my intention and I felt flooded with shame. I looked up as Agress, still unleashing a barrage of cruel words, caused the hobgoblin to lose all hope for this world and leap to his death.

As the villagers began to grab what weapons they could from the bodies and cried out, Gilikan reassured them of their rescue and began to release the chains to the pit as I swung down to assist with the lock. My thoughts about these deaths would have to wait as I searched the bodies for a key. I found what I was looking for along with a strange rolled up pouch with an odd smelling black substance within. Seemed like something Seamus might understand and I tossed it up to him.

I opened the lock to a sea of muddy faces. A blonde haired dwarf by the name of Morak began helping me get the children out. We gave what rations we could and the children gobbled up the meager food whilst Agress told them stories, casting shadow puppets off the purple light of Tel. For a moment she transported them away from their misery and despair to someplace joyful.
As we got the last of the villagers out, Morak asked how we had made it past the spiders to which we reponded with stoney silence.
I saw Gilikan and Seamus in conversation before Seamus hopped up on his back and went into a trance. His winged companion flew off into the tunnel and confirmed the infestation Morak spoke of. We threw the bodies of the goblins out into the tunnel and waited but the spiders did not take our bait. 

Seamus attempted to set their webbing on fire without success, then dabbed the black substance I had given him on himself and casually strolled into the tunnel alone. I thought he must be a genius until I saw him magically appear back running back to us flailing his limbs in an attempt to push himself faster. Gilikan who was guarding the entrance took the onslaught of spiders but was able to crush them with the sheer weight of his body and some assistance from Farora.
Developing a theory, Gilikan ignited the black substance on his pike, releasing a repugnant smell that Seamus confirmed was acting as a spider repellent. Farora began making some odd high pitched noises. It took me a minute to realize she was conversing with the giant spider. She told us they accepted the goblin meat but she could not assure us passage. As we didn't have enough repellent for our entire party to pass, Gilikan attacked the spider. He pierced it and was sprayed in the same pungent substance but not before getting caught by it's web. The spider retreated and we freed Gilikan, collecting what black ooze we could.
Having no alternative but to move forward we began to make our way into the tunnel. Farora took a shot at the giant spider, which took cover behind the rock formations. Instinctively I climbed up on to the roof to get a better shot with my shortbow, using the webbing to brace myself. I got a lethal looking shot on it but as I disturbed (and got stuck to) the webbing, a multitude of various sized spiders (none of them small) began to scuttle towards me. I hoped my death would give my friends enough opportunity to escape but they had other plans. 

I felt my faith and resolve strengthen as Tel cast a shimmering field around me. Seamus sent his tressym to me, breathing fire and incinerating most of the arachnids tearing into my flesh. My eyes began to blur as I heard the distant voice of Agress mocking "...a tiny cat got you!" I saw the shapes of at least three giant spiders descending on my friends. Filled with panic and dread, I managed to free myself and drop to the ground. Farora and Tel were trapped in webbing, I did what I could to help Farora before cowardly running back into the cave, screaming for the guards to help us. As Morak and his guards rushed forward it became more difficult to see. I could make out Tel ripping himself free of webbing, Gilikan stabbing with his pike but Farora faced an onslaught of attacks that should have been meant for me.

Filled with the fury of their captivity, the guards made some deadly attacks on the spiders whilst Agress rushed to heal Farora, much to my relief.
I watched helplessly as Seamus was trapped by one of the spiders and lifted into the air but before I could move, he disappeared from it's grasp only to reappear shooting bolts of fire at it. Another of the spiders grabbed a guard who wasn't so lucky and dragged him off into the abyss. I imagine his screams will haunt my nightmares for many moons to come. Unable to make my way into the tunnel, I shot the spider that had ensnared Farora but it did little to alleviate my guilt. Tel smashed the face of another giant spider, embedding his weapon in its eyes. The guards were able to finish off the final giant spider whilst Gilikan took care of the smaller arachnids, stomping them to Oblivion.

Gilikan and Tel gave me their healing potions and Agress healed me as we had no time to lose and I was incredibly weak. We covered ourselves and our weapons in the black sludge and began our climb up the tunnels towards the entrance. It took hours before we were able to make it back to the three tunnels. Although there was now light emitting from the passage we originally came from, we felt there was no choice but to continue on this path for fear of getting lost in the caves forever. It took another hour of climbing as I led our group upwards, the spiders following behind, watching our ascent. As we approached the entrance I stopped, hearing many different voices and ushered Farora in front as she might be better able to understand what kind of argument was occurring. I saw her face in the light as she peaked around the corner to get a better look at the situation. Her expression filled me to the core with dread.
