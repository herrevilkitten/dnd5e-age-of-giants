</ul>
<p>Discussion between the party and the dragon about whether Zephyros can be trusted.  The dragon and Zephyros had further discussion, including the giant’s vision.  The dragon, Clarion, sent her dwarves to investigate the castle for anything incriminating.</p>
<p>Zephyrus mentioned that the party was to be dropped off at Goldenfields.  The dragon is concerned about the Ordning and how it can affect the lesser races – if <a href="https://theageofgiants.obsidianportal.com/characters/hekaton">King Hekaton</a> is no longer in charge, it can create difficulties.  Clarion said that Zephyros should contact her directly.</p>
<p>Clarion asked the party to warn everyone in the places that the party is visiting: Goldenfields, <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Triboar">Triboar</a>, and <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bryn_Shander">Bryn Shander</a>.  She offered to pay them even more (10 platinum) to warn everyone they comes across about the danger from the giants.</p>
<p>Zephyros bristled at that.</p>
<p>Zephyros said that the party is capable and he would give them equipment to help them defend themselves against any giants.  He confirmed that King Hekaton would not break the peace.</p>
<p>Clarion gave him a week to investigate and told him to contact her at <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dagnabbet_Waybeard">Queen Dagnabbet</a>’s palace.  She also said that she would prevent other dragons from taking action.</p>
<p>The dwarves found nothing out of the ordinary and Clarion – and the dwarves – left, more or less peacefully.</p>
<p>Zephyros thanked everyone for coming to his aid and then provided gifts to them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stone tablets</li>
<li>3 potions (Potions of Greater Healing)</li>
<li>Bracers</li>
</ul>
<p>The bracers were given to Gilikan and Tel.  Zephyros explained that these devices will allow them to change their size to match giants.  Seamus was warned about his fate and how the gods were looking at him.  He received the stone tablets (a spellbook) to study.</p>
<p>Two of Zephyros’ gryphons were given to the party to aid them in their travels.  The party was warned about treating them well.</p>
<p>Agress attempted to feed the gryphon.  It went poorly.  Zephyros suggested a diet of deer.</p>
<p>The party discussed just <em>how</em> to warn the towns.</p>
<p>Zephyros indicated that this is not <em>really</em> about attacking the lesser folk but about showing dominance – especially over the other giant races.  He also suggested that Clarion is trying to stoke up fear of giants and the acolytes that showed up was not just a coincidence.  He said the party should raise the alert, but if they do encounter giants (frost, fire, stone, storm), they should flee.  Hill giants, however, are dimwitted and should be easier to deal with.</p>
<p>He then gave them a scroll that will copy anything that is written on it to a scroll possessed by King Hekaton. They was told not to write anything on it <em>for at least a day</em>.  It is especially critical to do this if there is a giant attack.</p>
<p>Gilikan asked about the Seven.  Zephyros replied that they are known to the Fey as powerful and dangerous mortals, who became immortal.  They exist in a different realm.</p>
<p>The castle came to a stop just outside of Goldenfields.  Zephyros told Seamus to try and mend a window with information from the stone spell book.</p>
<p>Zephyros said that Goldenfields was built on the ruins of a garden from one of their cities, that was destroyed in the war.  He did not expect the party to have any problems but they should be wary no matter what.</p>
<p>The party was taken (by gryphon) over the city.  It looks like a large home is being converted into a temple of some sort.  It was decided to enter by the main gate.</p>
<p>Shava is not good at flying.  She is good at falling, however.  There was almost a tragedy in the air as Shava fell and Tel was left alone, in terror.  Fortunately, the rest of the party acted quickly.</p>
<p>After the party landed, the gryphons attracted a great deal of attention from onlookers.  Everyone was being examined as they entered the city.  The way that the party and the gryphons dealt with the children helped the people warm up to the party.  After an hour, the party finally reached the gate.</p>
<p>Two wooden statues of <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Chauntea">Chauntea</a> flanked the gate.  Archers and foot soldiers guarded the entrance.  The guards inspected the party’s bags.  They were <em>very</em> interested in the amount of wealth that the party had.  The <em>bag of holding</em> that the party acquired from the cultists was even more interesting.  Seamus attempted to stop the guard from putting his hand in but that just encouraged the guard more.  After placing his arm into the bag, a ghostly hand emerged followed by an apparition.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Agress attempted to put the apparition back in the bag and then mocked it mercilessly.</li>
<li>Seamus decided to dazzle it with flashy lights.  It was much more effective on the guards.</li>
<li>Tel activated his <em>sacred weapon</em>.</li>
<li>Gilikan attempted to attack it with his pike, but it failed.</li>
<li>The Stalker struck Gilikan and missed Agress.  Then it turned invisible.</li>
<li>Shava waited.</li>
<li>Farora cast <em>bark skin</em> on Agress and waited.</li>
<li>The remaining guards waited.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Agress cast <em>faerie fire</em> but only some of the guards were affected.</li>
<li>Seamus moved out of the inner cluster.</li>
<li>Tel cast <em>protection from good and evil</em> on Agress and then moved.</li>
<li>Gilikan waited.</li>
<li>The Stalker appeared and attacked a number of guards.  Shava hit with an arrow.  Farora placed a <em>hunter’s mark</em> on the Stalker.  A priest guard cast <em>spirit guardians</em>.  All of the other guards attacked.</li>
<li>Shava muddied her hands and struck the Stalker twice.</li>
<li>Farora cast <em>ensnaring strike</em> and attacked.  She managed to strike the Stalker.</li>
<li>The priest among the guards then rushed forward and attacked.</li>
<li>The guards attacked again.  One cast <em>sanctuary</em> on Shava and another cast <em>sacred flame</em> on the creature.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Agress waited.</li>
<li>Seamus attempted to <em>fire bolt</em> the Stalker.</li>
<li>Tel attempted to strike it, but missed.</li>
<li>Gilikan did manage to damage the creature.</li>
<li>Agress suggested that the creature get back into the bag.  It halfway followed her suggestion and decided to just leave.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>After the battle with the Stalker, a battle of wits happened between the priest and the party.  The priest accused the party of bringing the demon to the city and the party lied somewhat about its origin.  Afterwards, Gilikan explained that the party was here to report the death of [Miros]’ parents and the priest became much warmer towards the party.</p>
<p>At the end of the discussion, Shava asked that Hamatous gather all of the mayors of the town together so that the party could deliver their warning.  The party then discussed what to do with the gryphons.  They were able to find stables for the them.  The stable master offered to point out a place for them to get saddles and where to get training with <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dasharra_Keldabar">Dasharra Keldabar</a> in the coastal village of <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Fireshear">Fireshear</a>.  Bring warm clothes.</p>
<p>The party was told about the strange behavior of the local bears and then went to the local inn (actually bungalows) in order to get a good rest in.</p>
