The party was directed towards a central hill which was surrounded by homes.

The entrance of the town had three shops:
* In the center, a stone building with barrels called Earthmother's Bounty.  It sold seeds, tinctures, and healing herbs.
* On the left, a blacksmith
* On the right, the stables where the gryphons are being kept

To the north, there are large fields of wheat divided up.  Beyond that, groves of trees and orchards.

The party (Shava) decide that the focus should be on finding lodging and then a pub.

Rows of small bungalows house families and there is a small cluster of administrative buildings.

Seamus accosted a passerby and asked where a fletcher could be found.  The party was told to keep going in the direction they were going.  They eventually came to a cluster of buildings with  a restaurant, an inn (North Furrow's End), a blacksmith, an armorer, and a small house with smoke coming out of the chimney and glass windows.  Shava checked out the house but decided this is not the time of day to be a proper creeper.

Farora and Seamus decided to check out the armorer's goods.  Farora needed arrows and the shopkeeper brought out a variety of arrows for her to check out.  Seamus had things to things to sell.  He also asked about lances and spears.

Shava and Tel also decided they had gold to burn.

The party bought _all_ of the arrows.

Farora checked out the armorer's place for a small upgrade.

We then ventured to the arcane shop.  After a small explosion, we were let into the establishment.  A proprietor (who was apparently "assigned" to this location) showed us around.

Seamus bought a number of scrolls.  The proprietor noticed he had a particular interest in one (_fly_) and offered a deal for the party: bring her some hard-to-acquire spell components
* Bat guano
* Sulfur

from the nearby hills in return for the scroll.  She mentioned there are hill giants there.  And
* the egg of a basilisk

After some bargaining, the party was offered a large discount (25%) in return for this quest.  She told the party to avoid the hill giant and the location of the cave where they can get guano and sulfur.

She gave some advice on how to deal with basilisks, such as avoiding its gaze, using lights to distract it, and using a mirror to give it a fake rival.
