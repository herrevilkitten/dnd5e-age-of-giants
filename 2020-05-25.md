The party was directed towards a central hill which was surrounded by homes.

The entrance of the town had three shops:
* In the center, a stone building with barrels called Earthmother's Bounty.  It sold seeds, tinctures, and healing herbs.
* On the left, a blacksmith
* On the right, the stables where the gryphons are being kept

To the north, there are large fields of wheat divided up.  Beyond that, groves of trees and orchards.

The party (Shava) decide that the focus should be on finding lodging and then a pub.

Rows of small bungalows house families and there is a small cluster of administrative buildings.

Seamus accosted a passerby and asked where a fletcher could be found.  The party was told to keep going in the direction they were going.  They eventually came to a cluster of buildings with  a restaurant, an inn (North Furrow's End), a blacksmith, an armorer, and a small house with smoke coming out of the chimney and glass windows.  Shava checked out the house but decided this is not the time of day to be a proper creeper.

Farora and Seamus decided to check out the armorer's goods.  Farora needed arrows and the shopkeeper brought out a variety of arrows for her to check out.  Seamus had things to things to sell.  He also asked about lances and spears.

Shava and Tel also decided they had gold to burn.

The party bought _all_ of the arrows.

Farora checked out the armorer's place for a small upgrade.

We then ventured to the arcane shop.  After a small explosion, we were let into the establishment.  A proprietor (who was apparently "assigned" to this location) showed us around.

Seamus bought a number of scrolls.  The proprietor noticed he had a particular interest in one (_fly_) and offered a deal for the party: bring her some hard-to-acquire spell components
* Bat guano
* Sulfur

from the nearby hills in return for the scroll.  She mentioned there are hill giants there.  And
* the egg of a basilisk

After some bargaining, the party was offered a large discount (25%) in return for this quest.  She told the party to avoid the hill giant and the location of the cave where they can get guano and sulfur.

She gave some advice on how to deal with basilisks, such as avoiding its gaze, using lights to distract it, and using a mirror to give it a fake rival.

The party also asked about rations, warm clothing, and other things.

Seamus decided to play around with the _bag of holding_, which seriously drew the attention of the shopkeeper.  A bag of gold (35gp) and a scroll fell out.  The scroll had instructions for the cultists that attacked the party in Zephyros' tower.  The instructions included an address in the city of [Ascore]:

> Meadows Alley, 3rd house on the left. Basement. You know what to do.

Agress was able to acquire two bungalows for the party.  They rested for the day in preparation for the Arcanist's quest and then ventured to the cave -- on foot.

Shava missed a patch of "heaving grass" on the ground, but fortunately Seamus noticed it.  He was able to warn her.  After examining it, she realized it was a sleeping giant using the dirt as a blanket.

The party - except for Tel - managed to quietly pass the giant.  Even so, they did not alert the giant and were able to make it to the cave. (Bat Guano Cave)

Tel stepped forward to peer inside of the cave and Farora pointed out the drop offs to him.

The party did not plan as much as they should have and did not have rope and spikes for the drop offs.  One idea that came to mind was to have the party in the _bag of holding_ while Shava brought them down.  In the end, Shava prepared the way with rope and the rest of the party followed after.

Tel anchored the rope around a very large rock.  Seamus went down with Gilikan.  Farora went down next, followed by Tel.  At the bottom, the cave split into left and right.  The smell of sulfur came from the right and the smell of _something_ came from the left.

Seamus made his way through the tunnel on the right and was able to get a lot of sulfur.  While he was in there, a swarm of bats flew through and began attack Farora.

----
* Tel cast _santuary_ on Farora and called on everyone to get down and let the bats pass.
* Gilikan stabbed some bats with his spear.
* Shava slapped some bats, finishing off the swarm.
* After eliminating the smaller bats, a group of giant bats attacked, which Shava also attacked.
* Seamus overheard the Flying Doom and began making his way back to the party.  He cast _dragon's breath_ on Tel.
* Farora cast _speak with animals_ and attempted to explain the situation.
* The bats attempted to attack.  Farora was warded by Tel's spell and the bat missed Gilikan.  Gilikan responded with an attack of his own.

---

* Tel moved under the bats and breathed fire straight up at them.  One of them managed to avoid some of the flames and the other became flambe'd dinner.
* Gilikan finished off the remaining bat.

---

The party continued down the left-hand fork towards the smell of guano.  The party followed their noses towards the source of the smell.  They noticed some scratches in the rocks in one tunnel and followed it, expecting the basilisk eggs to be in that direction.

Farora led the way and the others followed, with Shava holding a mirror.  The basilisk was asleep, wrapped around an egg.  After some quiet discussion, the party thought about switching the egg for a rock.  Shava "volunteered" by virtue of being the only rogue-like person in the group.

* Shava snuck up to the basilisk and attempted to replace the egg with a rock.
* She carefully pushed the egg up with her staff.
* She carefully placed the rock in the egg's place.
* She snuck back to the party.

The party went to a different tunnel to collect guano.  Gilikan sacrificed his sense of smell in order to collect guano.  After he found some bones in the guano, he noped out of there and the party made their way out of the cave.

As they were leaving, the basilisk woke and realized something is wrong.  It began to give chase and the party switched to a run.  Shava ran very fast.

Seamus and Gilikan made it up easily.  Tel and Farora did not.

> "I love it when Tel rolls." -- Don Pooch

Tel continued to struggle to climb.  Farora reached the top.  The basilisk was almost snapping at Tel's feet.  Seamus cast _hypnotic pattern_, which dazzled the basilisk and caused it to act cat-like. Tel finally ascended the rope and the party fled the cave as rapidly as possible.

They passed the sleeping giant and made it back to Goldenfields, ready for strong drink at the inn of Miros
