Traveling on the road north towards Baulders Gate 6 adventurers found themselves exhausted after a long trek over a mountain pass. As rain began to fall a heavy mist came up obscuring their path to the point they had to look straight down to watch their step. Suddenly a warm glow began to appear from the mist, and out of nowhere they individually found themselves being fed a fine meal in front of a warm hearth by a kindly innkeeper. As the innkeeper and his assistant Bast hurried to their needs, two of the travelers a half elf monk named Shava and a Goliath named Gillikan noticed that the helper seemed two shimmer and change appearance but only while they did not look directly at him. Curious Shava approached another of the weary travelers a Halfling of the name Seamus and asked him if he knew enough of Magic’s to ascertain what was going on.

While attempting to cast a spell within the bar the innkeeper kindly asked him to not cast a spell within his establishment. Before being able to finish pointing him in the direction of the commode Seamus left the Inn and cast his detect magic spell outside. Bast clearly was giving off a magical aura but it was different than any aura Seamus had ever seen before. 

Still concerned with the travelers safety Shava decided to gather them all in a room. After some discussion they decided to have a look around. Agress a wood elf ranger agreed to sneak around with Shava while the others waited and distracted the innkeeper. Despite their best efforts the 2 sneaks failed to find anything strange other than 2 strange glyphed boxes warm to the touch but cool on the inside. The Goliath enjoyed a warm bath and caused a ruckus to distract the innkeeper and Bast but inadvertently angered Bast with his requests.

Later that night while the adventurers slept, wisely in pairs, Bast entered the room of Gillikan paralyzing him and Farora. Three odd questions were asked and a warning given not to mention this conversation in the morning. Pay for his stay and leave quickly or face dire consequences.

Unfortunately, as Goliath’s are wont to do, the warning was not headed. The next morning the travelers were all having breakfast when the headstrong Gillikan began relating the story. Suddenly a warning reminder came from the corner of the room by the hearth. Determined the Goliath continued with his tale only to enrage the assistant. So it was that the kindly innkeeper entered the room and stood between his assistant and the party. He begged them to leave and pay for their night stay. Charging them a paltry sum in comparison to the services rendered. As the travelers walked away from the inn a strange fog obscured the inn and then it was suddenly gone. But not before the angry face of Bast could be seen in the window. 

Later that day, the group encountered a small group of bandits robbing a carriage. Intervening successfully, there were only two things of note.

1. At one point while the Goliath was striking at an opponent the visage of Bast the innkeepers assistant distracted him for a moment causing him to miss.
2. As one of the bandits ran for his life a warband of hundreds of goblins stampeded through the forest and seemingly ignored the group. That is until one of them noticed Seamus the halfling saluting them while in the forest. Another tripped over the leg of Tel the Dwarf as he made to hide behind the carriage. All this while the screams of the final bandit could be heard within the forest as he had been spotted by the warbands leader, and was overtaken by a small group of Kobolds.

After having cleared the Goblins from the first floor of the Inn, our heroes were confronted by the Goblin Leader Mok, Sneering upon their success he casually returned upstairs daring the Reavers to follow. Smelling a trap, Gillikan, Agress, Shava and Farora began taking tables, chairs, anything they could get their hands on blocking off the windows, kitchen and front door. Listening intently at the stairs while the others blocked the entrances, Seamus and Tul heard someone being dragged and gagged above them. As the group gathers at the stairs preparing to ascend, Seamus and Tul inform the rest of the situation. As they begin to ascend, suddenly two spears shoot past the heads of Seamus and Tul hurled by Muk. Quickly the Goblin leader runs into a room next to him. After clearing the other rooms, the Reavers confronted the Goblin leader holding a hostage. Shava going through the exterior of the Inn After stalling them for a moment the leader throws his hostage into a gaping hole to the bar area below and shoots an explosive crossbow bolt igniting a fire in the floor below.
