The party celebrated the success of their mission to the [Cave of Bat Shit].  The shopkeeper who gave them this quest, Naxenne, came over with the party's reward.  After a few drinks, she regaled Seamus with stories of her youth and training and what she does around the town.  Gillikan swore to hold a ball for her, which delighted her.  She switched to regaling him with the stories of her baller days at the magician academy.

While talking with Miros, the bartender, he discussed his past.  He explained that he used to travel in a circus and he used to be the "hairy man" act.  Amongst themselves, the party discussed who and how he should be informed of his parents' deaths.
