As the Reavers spent the night resting in the crumbling citadel I stole away with the components I'd scavenged from the town, needing some privacy to conduct my research. One of the towers fared worse than the others but still provided me a respite from distractions along with an unobstructed view of the night sky. The Eyes of Elah shone bright in the west, an auspicious omen indeed.

I set to my task, working quickly but deliberately, drawing out the circle using the glyphs I had studied. Satisfied with my work, I began the incantations that would summon forth a physical manifestation of good fortune. Or so I theorized, this modification to the age old summoning of a familiar was rather new to me.  The concept was sound, although I may have miscalculated or fate had its own ideas that night. A rift appeared in my binding circle, and while the ritual was complete the resulting conversation was hardly expected. An as yet to be determined entity spoke to me of a coming conflict, and asked me of my role in it. In my excitement I no doubt responded with something of great eloquence and gravitas, but the exact details escape me for my attention was drawn to the gift I had been bestowed. In place of the tressym I had heroically rescued the day prior was a being of matching countenance yet radically different substance. There was something behind its eyes, more than just an intelligence, and for a moment I saw myself as though through its eyes. The celestial being had been prattling along during this time about one thing or another, but did give a name to my new charge: Azeera.

With the sunrise came dark tidings and unwelcome guests. What appeared to be the goblin army we had introduced ourselves to in the forest the day prior had arrived at Nightstone. They had gathered some orc associates by the looks of it and were amassing on the southwest side of the city. The citadel was abuzz with activity as hasty plans were devised. A pyrotechnic marionette show with a projectile encore thanks to the finding of a fully-functional trebuchet. I had considered explaining to my newfound friends that the details of the plan were irrelevant, Lady Destiny had her hand on our backs, and she was pushing! I had neither the time nor the inclination to relate my theorems on luck to this diverse group. Admittedly the idea my new friends might make a mockery of my life's work much like those fools at the university may have stilled my tongue more than anything else. Successfully repurposing the trebuchet as a vehicle for escape would have proven with absolutely certainty that fate guided us but I could not convince anyone that it was almost likely to succeed. Nonsensical arguments regarding trajectories and the brain's capacity to remain conscious at high speeds were made and I quickly lost interest.

Time had run out, the army had organized itself and was moving for the gates. The plan, whatever had been decided, was set in motion. Understanding that the details were of little consequence, I positioned myself to most efficiently assist in aligning the events with the inevitable outcome. Our success was guaranteed, but that made what transpired no less spectacular to behold.

Tel, the stout dwarven Reaver, held up the recently deceased goblin leader from behind the parapet. Agress, a bold half-elf, blew the sound of retreat using the goblin's horn as if she'd been a goblin general in one of her past lives. This is a plausible theory that I could research on her behalf, I'll be sure to offer my services in that regard to her in the future. Gilikin the Twice-Orphaned Goliath launched a boulder many times my size at the besieging army, and Farora loosed an arrow from the tower. I'm sure she would have done just fine on her own, I'm no elven historian but I believe when they are born they are handed a bow in lieu of a rattle, but in the moment a minor adjustment to her arrow's flight path led to a greater alignment with the outcome that had been chosen for us. The accuracy of this new elven friend is particularly uncanny, I'd be willing to wager fortune favors her if a divine being isn't taking a more direct interest in her existence. But I digress.

As the elves rained death upon the assembled army and Gilikan launched boulders into their masses, a small group of cavalry arrived and Kella made for the city gates at a break-neck pace. We gave chase, fearing this dubious human meant to open the gates for an unknown enemy. The drawbridge was lowered, the horsemen charged in, and the drawbridge was slowly raised once again.

Not liking the odds of the drawbridge rising in time, I slowed the goblin advance with a network of webbing. The goblin numbers were too much for simple webbing, I made a note to in the future summon forth large spiders that could both create the webbing and deal with what becomes stuck therein. Efficiency improvements make lives easier, after all.

Orcs began to cling to the end of the drawbridge with their cohorts climbing them to gain entry to the city. Arrows continued to rain upon the orcs and goblins, Shava pummeled them about the face to much success, and the rest continued to raise the drawbridge despite the additional weight. With a bit of unintended irony I coated the orcs in a coating of pig fat, my earlier attempt at a fiery evocation being less than awe-inspiring. Some of the orcs and goblins slipped into the moat, others the victims of a constant rain of arrows, but the end result was as foretold. The drawbridge was raised.

A force of elves of a wilder persuasion appeared from the wheat fields, undoubtedly fleeing the advance of the prophesied mole people, and over the next hour or two diminished the goblin and orc army to just a minor nuisance. I believe some survivors fled, and the wild elves requested an audience with the Lady of Nightstone who had arrived at the gates with her personal guard.

Before the drawbridge could be lowered to allow for the elves' entry, the horsemen who had since unmounted and revealed themselves as ragtag mercenaries arrayed themselves in positions surrounding the Lady and her retinue. Apparently their leader is enamored of this Kella person, I believe we missed the chance to impress upon him her dubious nature and save him some heartache. No matter, for he showed his true colors by claiming dominion over the city as was his right as the city's savior. The words do seem unbelievable even as I write them but I assure the reader the man's audacity was real. Thankfully my companions appeared as astonished at the gall of this man as I, Gilikin so much so that he turned and bashed one of the mercenaries in a fury.

Tel was surrounded by these unwelcome infiltrators and after a brief scuffle made haste for the gate controls. Agress weaved through a tangle of foes to make her way into the other gate tower. The leader of these rapscallions actually had the presumption to take arms against the Lady of Nightstone, dealing her a foul wound. Farora laid hands upon her to heal her wounds and turned to take up arms. Shava beat the mercenary leader about the head and face with such rapidity it was as if she blurred and flowed about him.

For the first time since leaving the university, I found myself actually surprised. This was not how events should have unfolded. I had missed some variable, some sign, some portent that would have foretold of this conflict. Desperately reaching for some thread that would allow me to alter this course and set things aright, I grasped at an improbable likelihood. Paralyzing Kella with my magic, I wove in some errant bad luck that I'd tucked away earlier that morning as I saw it floating by. Satisfied she was indeed out of luck for the moment, I upped the ante and told her fawning admirer to throw down his weapons or Kella would die. His taste in women as bad as his ability to read a room, he took the opportunity for a quick nip from his flask. What an odd person!

As the drunken lunatic chased after me, Farora drew a blade to Kella's throat and the man finally paid attention to the road down which fate had taken him. If he'd had his eyes open when he arrived it would have been obvious from the start.

The brief skirmish had ended, but tensions were still high as the wild elves arrived and surrounded us all, weapons drawn.
