Despite the not amazing way that our relationship with the elves started (drawn bows make few friends) and their less than favorable look on our party (especially the ones without elven heritage), no fighting between us broke out.

The elven leader thought us too weak for the task of rescusing the villagers and the lady of the city foolish for sending us to what he assumed would be our deaths; even Gilikin's speech of how it's what we must do and the merits of bravery did not sway him. He did however give us gifts that we could enjoy during our final hours of foolishness and we sought to rescue the villagers: fine bows for each of us with elven heritage and a cloak for each of us to help us disguise ourselves. The best gift of all though was him taking Kella and her comrades hostage.

It had been a very long day with fighting goblins, being betrayed, fighting Kella, and then being insulted, so we rested for the night before going to rescue the villagers. The morning brought new light and also new information. Our goblin friend told us of a secret entrance to the cave with only two large guards and how to get to the villagers from there. He also told us of the recent changes in management when Gurosh, an orc, showed up last year and took over the caves. He took a rather aggressive management style and killed everyone who was in charge and forced the goblins to dig. Sadly it was time to save goodbye to our goblin friend as he and Merl, the kind man who we saved and then who saved us, needed to leave to seek their fortune elsewhere.

We took horses part way to the caves to help us carry back any injured villagers. Part way there, we spoted a goblin scout and Shava, being slowed down by her horse, vaulted off and caught up with him just as Seamus held him in place with his magic. Despite Farora's quick talking and Agress' bluffing, he was unwilling to help and would have informed the camp had we let him go. After having made friends with a goblin, we no longer felt so comfortable endlessly killing and instead tied him up and left him with the horses.

Upon finding the secret entrance and seeing that it's a 100 foot drop, we attach rope to climb down. Seamus and Agress descend downfirst and mind control an ogre named Mook to kill Gurosh and liberate the goblins. He lumbers off to do this and the rest of the party joins, but is soon discovered by Mook's mate, especially Tel who has fallen into a mushroom and is now glowing purple (we're not at all concerned, I'm sure the powder is harmless). We attack ruthlessly (gouging out an eye, dropping a stalactite on her, hitting her with weapons and many unkind words) until she is crying, attempting to crawl away only to be stopped by Gil's 2 handed hammer and later knocked out. 

With the guards dealt with, we follow the direction our goblin friend told us further into the caves using the purple light still coming off Tel to keep our footing. We come across humanoid bones, some picked clean, others with flesh still on them and continue towards the blood (making note of the yipping sounds of possible wargs to our left) until we come across a gate. Seamus sends light just beyond the gate illuminating two goblins and a cage of humans. Humans who are not very good at being rescued and instead of causing a distraction, immediately insist that they had nothing to do with the light. The goblins discovered us just as Shava finishes picking the lock.
